## Overview
**Weather_Site** is a simple weather web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This site allows users to get real-time weather information for any city or location by interacting with a user-friendly interface.

The site uses a weather API to fetch real-time data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The user simply inputs their desired location, and the app will display the latest weather details.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure the webpage content.
- **CSS3**: Style the site with a focus on responsiveness and modern design.
